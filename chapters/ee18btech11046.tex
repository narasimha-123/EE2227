\item Root Locus: \\
	  Root Locus is a method for plotting the locus of the poles of transfer function for different values of gain parameter K of the function from 0 to $\infty$.

\item How to draw a Root Locus	\\
     Let there be a Open-loop transfer function  $KG(s)$  with unit gain negative feedback. Then the closed-loop transfer function for that particular system is:
    \begin{align}
         \frac{N^{'}(s)}{D^{'}(s)}=\frac{K G(s)}{1+K G(s) H(s)}    
    \end{align}
    
     Then the characteristic equation which gives poles is: 
    \begin{align}
        1+KG(s)H(s)=0
    \end{align}
    
     \begin{enumerate}
	\item Locate the open loop poles and zeros in the s-plane.
	\item Find the number of root locus branches.

 The root locus branches start at the open loop poles and end at open loop zeros. So, the number of root locus branches 'N' is equal to the number of finite open loop poles 'P' or the number of finite open loop zeros 'Z', whichever is greater.
	\item Identify and draw the real axis root locus branches.

 If the angle of the open loop transfer function at a point is an odd multiple of $180^{\circ}$, then that point is on the root locus. If odd number of the open loop poles and zeros exist to the left side of a point on the real axis, then that point is on the root locus branch. Therefore, the branch of points which satisfies this condition is the real axis of the root locus branch.
	\item Find the centroid and the angle of asymptotes.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item If P=Z, then all the root locus branches start at finite open loop poles and end at finite open loop zeros.
	\item If P>Z , then Z number of root locus branches start at finite open loop poles and end at finite open loop zeros and P−Z number of root locus branches start at finite open loop poles and end at infinite open loop zeros.
	\item If P<Z , then P number of root locus branches start at finite open loop poles and end at finite open loop zeros and Z−P number of root locus branches start at infinite open loop poles and end at finite open loop zeros

	\end{itemize}
So, some of the root locus branches approach infinity. Asymptotes give the direction of these root locus branches. The intersection point of asymptotes on the real axis is known as centroid.
\begin{align}
Centroid =\frac{\sum \text {Real(poles)}-\Sigma \text {Real(zeros)}}{P-Z}
\end{align}
The formula for angle of asymptotes $\theta$ is
\begin{align}
\theta=\frac{(2 q+1) 180^{0}}{P-Z}
\end{align}
where q is any integer between (0,(P-Z)-1)


	\item Find the intersection points of root locus branches with an imaginary axis. Whiich can be found using Routh array method
	\item Find Break-away and Break-in points.
	\item Find angle of departure and angle of arrival

The formula for the Angle of Departure $\phi_{d}$ is
\begin{align}
\phi_{d}=180^{0}-\phi
\end{align}
The formula for the Angle of Arrival $\phi_{a}$ is
\begin{align}
\phi_{a}=180^{0}+\phi
\end{align}
Where,
\begin{align}
\phi=\sum \phi_{p}-\sum \phi_{z}
\end{align}
where $\phi_{p}$ is angle of open loop poles and $\phi_{z}$ is angle of open loop zeros.
     \end{enumerate}
    
    
    

\item Breakaway Point \\
    While varying 'K', the point where the Root Locus enters real axis is called a 'Breakaway Point'. \\
A breakaway point is the point on a real axis segment of the root locus between two real poles where the two real closed-loop poles meet and diverge to become complex conjugates. Since a Breakaway point corresponds to the point where root locus meets real axis. As the root locus is symmetric about real axis there will be two roots at the Breakaway point. 
i.e.,
    \begin{align}
        K=-\frac{1}{G(s)}=-\frac{D(s)}{N(s)}    
    \end{align}

    \begin{align}
        \frac{d K}{d s}=-\frac{d}{d K}\left(\frac{D(s)}{N(s)}\right)=0 
    \end{align}
    Once a pole breaks away from the real axis, they can either travel out towards infinity (to meet an implicit zero), or they can travel to meet an explicit zero, or they can re-join the real-axis to meet a zero that is located on the real-axis. 

\item Calculation of Breakaway point \\

Given,the characteristic equation:
    \begin{align}
        s^2 + 6Ks + 2s + 5 = 0    
    \end{align}
    
    Dividing with $s^2 + 2s + 5$ on both sides, we get
    \begin{align}
        1+\frac{6 k s}{s^{2}+2 s+5}=0    
    \end{align}
    This is of form $1+KG(s)=0$ which is closed loop characteristic equation, so that along the root locus
    segments on the real axis ($s = \sigma$)
    \begin{align}
        K=-\frac{1}{G(s)}=-\frac{D(s)}{N(s)}    
    \end{align}

    \begin{align}
        \frac{d K}{d s}=-\frac{d}{d K}\left(\frac{D(s)}{N(s)}\right)=0    
    \end{align}
    \begin{align}
        K=\frac{-\left(s^{2}+2 s+5\right)}{6 s}=-\frac{1}{6}\left[s+2+\frac{5}{s}\right]    
    \end{align}
    And,
    \begin{align}
        \frac{d k}{d s}=0 \Rightarrow\left[1-\frac{5}{s^{2}}\right]=0 
    \end{align}
    Solving for s, we get
    \begin{align}
        s^{2}-5=0 \Rightarrow s=\pm \sqrt{5}    
    \end{align}
    Since, 's' can only be in left half of plane
    \begin{align}
        \boxed{s=-\sqrt{5}}    
    \end{align}
    
    Therefore the Breakaway point is at ($-\sqrt{5}$,0)
